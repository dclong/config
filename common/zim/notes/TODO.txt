====== TODO ======
Created Wednesday 19 March 2014
@todo 

1. figure out where is the best location to put your alias and configuration files, .profile or .bash_profile, check the login shell page

2. fix the NFS problem, check ZFS, it seems that it has zfs send functionality

3. See how you can redirect warnings of GUI applications to a file or /dev/null

6. local copy of tax?

7. extract your notes in [[MongoDB]]

8. Virtual machine is a good way to learn new technologies, 
summary steps to learn Oracle SQL OTN_... and big data, virtual machines ...

9. Encrypt and copy some of your private files to Dropbox 
so that they can be accessed everywhere.
You'd better write a script and schedule a job to do so.

[ ] write a thunderbird config file, refer to link http://kb.mozillazine.org/Transferring_data_to_a_new_profile_-_Thunderbird#Identify_what_you_want_to_salvage. Also you have to make sure that symbolic links doesn't cause any problems. I somehow remeber that symbolic links caused filter problems before. 
[ ] add an example about goto in tips for sas
give an example about the type=data_type ... sas tips
add an example about // and || and !!
[ ] thinking about how to come up with a point estimator in situations
when mean, media and mode are not immediately applicable. 
\theta^n_i \sim F_n
d is some metric
use the \theta in \{\theta_i\} that has the minimum distance to others on average. 
What properties does this estimator have? 
Specially when n goes to infinity, what happens?
[ ] 2. UARS non-regular, von Mises regular, try it and see whether it works
[ ] vole is going to shake the world, I think it's the future of social network
thinking about develop a apps platform for vole and sell apps on it
this is also a brilliant idea!
[ ] 个人形像设计
[ ] keep an eye on shogun which is a toolbox for machine learning
learn Data-Driven Documents
study more about all kinds of machine learning algorithms
and how to use them
[ ] 1. make tranv more powerful, first work on marix and list,
second, possible accept varadic arguments ...
your collapse function requires arguments have no special chars 

4. write a function to help you run script in a file line by line,
for lines that should be treated together, run them together
this sounds like not easy, mostly, how to group lines correctly ...
use a point to lines in file and so on ...
[ ] write a blog to broardcast yourself, who you are, 
what skills you have, what want to do in future, ideas, 
and so on
let people know that you're different, you're special!
also, thinking about build a more professional website of yourself
questons: if I point my guithub blog to another one ...
buy a domain name!!!
publish your packages and so on!!!
[ ] install vehicle dvr ...
[ ] move java-jmail and dclong.jmail to github and invite people to contribute to it
ars package ...
and cpp-spt, dclong.fs, dclong.jio
submit all your usable r packages to cran
[ ] Zhaoshang yinhang, change email address to longendu@gmail.com if possible
[ ] make your git.sh more robust, if not git repository ... and so on
[ ] learn D3, jQuery, AJAX and so on
[ ] check the 2 examples of adding lines numbers to pdf 
see whether they are useful for you
[ ] presentation ideas:
let computer recognize human gesture while doing presentations, combined with voice recognition,
I think it's easy to implement things such waving hand -> go to next slide
this save people hassle of using clipboard, but you should let people using clipboard

I'm acutally thinking more on this, is it possible to let machine highlight words or point at 
words automatically, as we do presentation?
I think it is not hard, but voice recognition is very important!!!

or combine hand gesture and voice, let point point ...
it is possible,
[ ] blog about the notes taking program
and other programs you wrote
[ ] extract data from http://uk.camelcamelcamel.com/ and see whether you can 
predit price well
[ ] learn SQL, PIG, Hadoop and scalding, OpenBugs, make/cmake, Spark (big data, berkerly)
eclim
[ ] write a program to analyze your income and expense
[ ] a stackoverflow-like replacement for MITBBS
[ ] think about whether you can solve the parking problem
[ ] write-up for Jianzhong's project
[ ] start writing a book about human brain simulation after accumulating enough experience and knowledge,
I image this book will be the greatest technical book that is every sold
[ ] write a post to talk about "Yangguizi"
[ ] write a program to solve absorption probability and expected absorption time in Markov chains with absorption state
[ ] write a linux user guide book when you have time
put together all good software and tips you have
[ ] find an alternative of btsync (not Dropbox) which is faster on syncing small files
[]create vim commands for frequent tasks:
1. increamental numbers,
insert/remove a specific character at a given column
2. capitalize all words on a line
3. combining AutoKey, Senelium and pass/pwman3, you can do lots of cool things, 
it can also be a GUIless replacement for keepassx
[ ] building all kinds of database is also a very good idea, 
just thinking about how much money carfax makes
possible databases: smart robot database, dating database
[ ] text mining can be very useful too
currently text mining algorithms are too simple
I think you consider the Markov properties of words, and also the contexture ...
Except understanding what the text means, this can also be used to analyze 
profession writings to find possible mistakes ...
[ ] you can probably write a program to check capitalization of words ...
and later, a comprehensive grammer check software
[ ] plane tickets, point, hotels, points
[ ] there seems to be a bug about your pname function? prefix? really strange, debug it.
collapse function, no special characters ...
it seems that reurn alone doesn't return, you probably have talk about this before
[ ] linear model, parameter estimable, depends on the design matrix.
But if we change the design matrix just a little bit, this might change the estimability 
of parameters. What does this mean? and what's the relationship between penalized linear regression?
[ ] about estimating parameters, if we have multiple estimators,
and we know they excel in different areas, we can first estimate parameters 
and then adjust according to the range estimates belongs to, right?
[ ] I did a study about exp distribution and truncated (integer) exp distribution before,
intuitively exp should be able to estimate parameters better, 
but based on my simulation, it doesn't seems to be so.
You probably want to study this again.
[ ] You probably have done this in your "Statistics Thinkings"
Gamma distribution, arriving rate explanation, convolution of exp distributions
as conjugate prior of Poission distribution a/b?

beta and binomial distribution, weighted average, normal distribution and so on

inv gamma disribution variance

conditional distribution of multivariate normal distribution
[ ] EM algorithm:
* How many observations are needed in order to estimate all parameters? 
And I think some parameters are indistinguishable, right?

2. local vs global maximum, if EM algorithms only finds the local maximum, 
what's the advantage? Because it always increases, I think there's a high chance that it 
finds the local maximum instead of the global maximum.

3. EM algorithm is slow? 

4. p(p, p^(i)) is a function of p, how can use numerical approximation if exact expectation is 
hard to find?
[ ] use getopts (instead of getopt) make your bash program more usable
[ ] cubature package adaptIntegrate
fCopulae package and adapt fun for multi-dimensional integration
there's problem with fCopulae and cubature, your example (last project at UB)
[ ] Feedsomekey.js
firebug: probably use it together with selenium to solve the NCREIF problem
[ ] read Econ 101, learn some basic stuff about economy
[ ] git.repository is often right about unpushed status but sometimes not.
maybe related to the fact you don't delete or modify any files, 
just git rm --cached ...
[ ] rewrite your vbill program in python
[ ] pdftk is great, works very well, but why don't Java Libs work?
[ ] flash drive cannot be format ...
Susan's flash drive, I tried all kinds of ways that I can on Linux
[ ] Chinese (or other asian) input method, I have a brilliant idea.  
It should offer an option to adjust frequency according to different time in a year.
[ ] extend you exce2csv code to support other ms office format, 
e.g., word, ppt, and other ... e.g., pdf (save as pdf)
[ ] learn advanced programming in bash, e.g., containers, modern loops and so on
[ ] your interesting TA experience
Xiaomei Hao and 
takasha i'm also pretty, oh, never mind ...
[ ] put wtg problems on your blog, but don't say it's WTG problems,
just say some fun problems
[ ] blog about ipython book, ip and so on
if you do that, also Julia IPython ...
[ ] mixing integer and row names is very dangerous!
if you use integers (tech string) as row names and then pass integer as row name ...
again found it's dangerous to compare double numbers directly, use error telorence
summarize things to be careful in numerical computing

r, numeric issue, overflow instead of inf, ...
[ ] blog about 4 parameter beta distribution, mean variance, 
density, cdf, quantile, etc
[ ] good idea to pass column names if data format is not consistent
in r, also applies to other programming languages having 
data frame object
you don't know what kind of data frame (column names, and order) you'll have
passing name as an argument is great idea
[ ] take log and then difference is a very common strategy in economics ....
[ ] repeat sale regression
[ ] summary good ways to build prior
Willson, Bayesian book, your experience, use language that exports are confident of ...
[ ] price check (amazon and clapp)
you can probably combine it with selenium to do fancy stuff
[ ] rotate in mathematica, correct, and see how you can ... Euler angle rotation ...
[ ] get a cheap linux server, or you can even think about using linux11
sign up virtual machine on digital ocean
currently you can use your own server, but what after you graduate?
[ ] messaging passing vs shared memory?
it sounds to me that messaging passing is gaining popularity recently,
but why does C++ and Java use shared memory approach?
[ ] start small business if you can, online, selling ...
if you really want to do online selling, only do expensive ones,
and use selenium to help you find deals
i think website is a potential good one to do
[ ] how to use multiple freuqency in crontabl? 
someone said useing 1/2 means 1, 3, 5, ...
but I tried, and seems not to work ...
[ ] get clear about ROC and CAP curves
[ ] time series, strong and weak stationary definition ...
check time series, do we have requirement of stationary on covariates? 
strange ...
time series model
[ ] high adjusted R square, I think it's either very good or very bad ...
[ ] Summary Skills And Tricks for Building Models
[ ] a good question, 10 random numbers, what aic?
[ ] multicolinearity, ridge regression, L1 penalty (lasso regression), 
combination of them and so on 
you might have already blogged on this
[ ] modify links in your blog to point them to bitbucket (or the right link)
[ ] and you should study effect of each data point on estimates, 
time series situation ...
[ ] separation problem, how to deal with it in modeling?
the idea of adjusting for sampling bias ...
resampling ... and so on
[ ] R, xtable, print, file, return value, summary latex ...
[ ] collect all kinds of data online for future study
[ ] industry, ..., pipe line ... model, many steps, error control and so on
[ ] R use setinternet2 if you are behind a firewall, and you fail to install packages
[ ] loess, I don't think it'sgood for prediction, it's merely for estimating curves
[ ] summarize on weighted linear regression
[ ] .gz file is gone after decompress, 
not sure this is how it is supposed to be or just a bug ...
[ ] why is some symbolic links copied to [[/usr/bin/X11?]]
[ ] thinking about the best way to solve the problem of 
loading external disk, 
probably put a line of script in ...?
[ ] vim cursor position, how to control that?
[ ] difference between "#!/usr/bin/env python" and #!/usr/bin/python?
[ ] a question mentioned by Dr. Nettleton, guess numbers
[ ] using bittorrent to do distributed stuff is cool
think about is there anything you can do related to this
[ ] I just come up with some ideas which people can potentially use to cheat 
when reviewing papers
[ ] type is more useful than alias in shell
[ ] pelican, latex, equation align environment works but need to use \newline isntead of \\
[ ] write a program using selenium to auto post on forum for you
[ ] think about putting ads on screensave of laptops and mobiles.
it's potentially a good idea,
ubuntu has the potential to do this
but probably not good, because no body look at it, 
and even when people are interested, no efficient to get the information
[ ] make a picture, "dimension" with wings -> high dimension
[ ] blog about how you made toshiba work again, sometimes, we just want a solution that works not a perfect solution ...
use earphone
[ ] blog about parking tickets, when high chance when low chance ...
evening close to 5, New Year, cold day
[ ] the strange problem of "waiting for /dev to be fully populated ..."
[ ] what the best way to sync eclipse configuration files?

程序自我删除\nhow to write a program which can delete itself?

现在是一个靠服务赚钱的时代

对于Time Series我一个非常confused的问题是初始时间的选取会不会影响分析结果呢？

multiple models vs confidence interval, which to use？\nDon't waste time think about this. \nRather, spend time thinking about how industry is different from academic

现在平均每个人可能都有好几张信用卡，还有一些虚拟的比如说Paypal等等，\n如果你能够将这些个东西合并起来的话，应该会大受欢迎。\n这个的主要问题的用户的新人以及各大信用卡公司的合作。\n不过你可以首先利用只能手机来做， 这样就大大减少了阻力，而且是的你之前关于Finance的很多想法\n可以实现。我觉得这两个想法可以合并。但是这个想法更为重要和关键。\nuse bar code (containing information of credit card and so on),\nor reversely, let use to scan barcode of shopping malls and send information to them

做一个让女性表达自己真实的梦或者梦想的平台，\n可以就叫做ihadadream.com\n\n提供各种fancy的工具让女人去尽情的描述刻画自己的梦境。。。\n\n提供各种工具让女人尽情的去表达自己的人生梦想。。。\n\n真是潜在的非常好的想法\n\n配合心理学，命运学，周公解梦等等。。。。

我突然觉得开一个出租一次性物品的商店应该也是个非常不错的想法，而且这个可以从网上经营\n比如说Hallowwen costume, 婚纱等等\nif you want to do this, do it in big cities!!!

给T-shirt配上各种袖套是不错的想法，可以做一做。你的想法挺多，问题是如何开始呢？\n我突然有更好的想法了，如果你能做出一个流行的网站，那么卖T-shirt的同时，你可以卖袖套，应该是个很不错的想法。\n问题时袖套需要定做吧?找哪个公司呢？

童年的回忆\n考虑做成漫画或电影形式 ...\n1. 动漫\n希曼，六神合体，一休哥，奥特曼，忍者神龟\n2. 食物\n笑话糖，棉花糖，糖果子\n3. 玩具\n猪的膀胱，铁链枪，泥巴碗反扣比谁的更响\n开裆裤\n飞机， 四角板（用纸折成）在地上互板，反面的被输掉。\n玻璃珠游戏，地上挖坑\n自行车，三脚架，骑车，就是小时候个子矮，不能像大人们一样骑车，但是可以骑三脚架，踩半圈（你可以搜集图片等等）\n弹弓，打鸟，烤着吃。。。\n池塘里游泳，扎猛子。。。\n（我想编一个关于80后的故事，从婴儿到老，最好老的时候，回忆儿童，正在看这个书等等，你可以历数80后经历的种种，当然也可以穿插期间中国发生的大事等等。。。\n这个故事需要弄得比较普遍，让人都有认同感。那可能得从农村娃入手。。。）\n4. 桑椹\n或者你可以考虑把这些东西揉为一体，编成一个（最好是一套故事，漫画，电视剧，类似的等等）\n我觉得做成小册子贩卖，每个独特的回忆给上一个独特的故事或是感想会比较好。越是让人感伤怀旧越好。\n赚钱方式一定要依赖于网络。\n现在的穿越剧非常火热...，想想有什么感悟\n这个弄得好甚至可以拍成电影 。。。\n而且这个甚至也可以做成游戏，不过市场可能会小了点。

考虑组建一个隐秘组织，主要是为了维护华人权益。\n所有组员每个月必须上交一定费用，比如说$5。\n费用的主要目的是让组员有付出感，从而更加对组织有归属感。\n收取的费用还可以用于其他各种活动。\n\n所有组织里面的成员相互帮助，比如说推荐工作等等。\n\n组织分层次，\n会员应该组织小规模的探讨活动等等，\n主要是实时更近政治动向，\n同时也可以关心其他方面的东西。\n\n1. 如何组织会员？所有会员对外开放，还是单向可见？\n\n这个取决于组织的目的。如果你希望组织能够以擦边球的形式惩罚损伤华人利益的个人或者团体，\n那么这个组织最好要低调，隐秘，并且单向可见可以从很大程度上保护领导人的安全等等。\n\n2. 会费交多少?\n$5/mo貌似是个不错的数目。首先费用不能过高，其次一定要收取会费。\n会费的首要目的是让会员有付出感，从而对组织有归属和忠诚感。\n收取的会费还可以用作其他目的。\n\n3. 是否可以收取赞助费用？\n这个是民间自发组织，虽然我们是维护政治利益的团体，但是我们尽量避免国家政治等等。\n所以不应该收取来自与政治/国家的赞助费用。即便收取，也要表明我们有独立的政治目标。\n\n4. 会员互助\n比如说某位会员发生意外，其他会员应该热情提供帮助。\n我觉得实名捐助是个不错的方法。\n\n5. 惩罚敌人\n\n6. 严格控制会员质量\n有政治理想，热情，乐于付出，同时有足够的经济实力

开发一套供自动驾驶汽车使用的bid系统也是个不错的想法

做一个让女性表达自己真实的梦或者梦想的平台， 可以就叫做ihadadream.com\n提供各种fancy的工具让女人去尽情的描述刻画自己的梦境。。。\n提供各种工具让女人尽情的去表达自己的人生梦想。。。\n配合心理学，命运学，周公解梦等等。。。。\n\nthe main problem is whether there are enough women who want to do this

1. symmetric, 地位相同,\n2. recursive, interative, reduce complexity of problem\nchange unknown problem to known problem, differetial equations

保形变换用于optimization? simulation annealing? 分形统计？partition?

创办一个网络追网站，主要在中国，用于对付逍遥法外的罪犯，各种迷案等等

中英汉字的一个差距是：中文汉字是元素的空间组合，而英文字母是基本元素的一维线性组合。是什么造成了这种差距？而这种差距有对不同民族的文化产生了什么样的影响？

对于习近平大大吃包子的事情，我事后的反应是为什么你之前没有想到去收集其相应的物件呢？比如说那把凳子。\n如果你这种思维多一点，那么你暴富只是迟早的事。

BitTorrent Sync打开了网络的洪水猛兽。你可以打广告挣钱。\n利用某些广大人民喜好的信息来勾引用户。可以借助与Vole来实现\n一个用于对付网络检查的办法是，给一个关键的key,利用常规网络宣扬。\n然后这个key可以用来获取某些关键机密或者盗版信息。\n这个key应该是read only的。
