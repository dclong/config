====== Mathematica ======
Created Saturday 21 June 2014

1. <> join strings, StringJoin, + in python, Java, etc. A missing <> not necesarry cause error but of course give you wrong answer, so be careful!!!
2. You can write program in plain text (and save it as .m file). You can import the functions in the file using Import[file_path]. This is the suggested way for you to manager your own Mathematica code.
3. You can specify scope of notebook "Evaluation -> Notebook's Default Context" and then select one of the options.
4. Be careful when you save your notebook as .m file. The stupid software comments out every line!!! You can just save it as plain text or copy and paste it into a .m file. 
5. The stupid Mathematica 9 screws up scopes. Even if you have run the definition of a function in a notebook that is set as global, it's not seen in other notebooks!!!
6. check whether a plain text file can also be imported!!!!
	a. mathematics 	Mathematics 	MATHEMATICS
7. just use ?FunName to get help of a function. If you are not sure whether a function is defined or not, this also helps.
8. the result of ParallelTable is the same as Table except for side effect of computation.
9. parallize[table[]]
10. use "" for string instead of ‘’
11. missing semicolon is a common mistake
12. cannot use _ in variable names, cause error message: Set::write: Tag Times in 1 x_ is Protected. >>
13. f[x_Real]:=x^2; pass integer to it won't work!!!
14. f[x_Real:3.]=x^2 default parameter
15. nohup math -run "<<../mle_2_10.m" & do not quote  in 	Mathematica you use <<"../mle_2_10.m", but here quote <<../mle_2_10.m instead of the file name.
16. Get[file_path] <<file_path Import[file_path]
17. nohup matlab -nodesktop -nosplash file.m (don't put & as it cause matlab not to start)
18. SetDirectory["/home/dclong/simulation"] Directory[] FileNames[]
19. it is suggested that you use java camelCase style to name variables in 	Mathematica which can distinguish them from functions
20. integer cannot be use in string concatenation directly, must use [[ToString]] to convert it to a String first.
21. mle [[/.]] Rule -> (#2 &)
