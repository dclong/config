====== UltiSnips ======
Created Sunday 08 June 2014


## UltiSnips
1. snip doesn't expand in *.snippet if not used via [[:UltiSnipsEdit?!!!]]
2. it seems that snippet.snippet doesn't support symbolic link? That is if I have "UltiSnip" point to a folder, then expansion won't work! It seems that only in a empy file? It seems that ... works in an empty file even if not open using the UltiSnipsEditor command.
3. unbalanced parentheses in triggers might cause problems!!!
4. UltiSnips 
	a. how to default to edit private snippets?
	b. why snippets (snip) doesn't trigger when edit directly?
ultisnips auto indent problem?
