====== Markdown ======
Created Monday 28 July 2014

1. cannot have too many empty lines before a list. 1 at most

2. immediately after a list, the code block should be indent 8 spaces,
the second code block only has to indent 4 spaces

3. it seems that you cannot directly embed pdf images, must use, jpg, png, git, etc.
4. not convenient to write latex align evnironment without equation number, don't use align*
use \nonumber to suppress equations numbers. 
The reason is that * has special meaning in markdown.
