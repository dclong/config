====== Bash ======
Created Saturday 17 May 2014

1. ls [[/home/*]] in bash, don't use it, instead use (/home/*) directly

ls -d "/home/dclong/btsync/backup/tbp_"*
instead of 
ls -d "/home/dclong/btsync/backup/tbp_*"
it seems to me that if you wildcard, then full names are returned, otherwise, short names are returned.

2. cp -a might not be a good idea sometimes, e.g., when in Cygwin/MobaXterm, because you might lose file permissions due to unmatch of users

not condition
if [ ! -d "$1" ]; then
    fi
