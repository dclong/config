====== Git ======
Created Wednesday 14 May 2014

1. The trick of creating executable scripts and push them to GitHub/Bitbucket to overcome the difficulty that you can change file permissions on bitbucket.
2. is it possible to let git keep original (creation) time stamps of files?
3. Switching branches carries uncommitted changes with you. Either commit first, run git checkout . to undo them, or run git stash before switching. (You can get your changes back with git stash apply)
4. git log origin/master..HEAD
5. git diff origin/master..HEAD
6. git log <since>..<until>

git pull --rebase origin master
git add <some-file>
git rebase --continue
git rebase --abort
