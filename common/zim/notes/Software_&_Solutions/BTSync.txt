8. Bittorrent Sync ignore directory?
it seems to the problem of ignoring directories only

10. bitcasa more free space

7. People say btsync is faster (especially for large files).
I guess this measures the transfer process. 
According to my experience, BTSync and Software:AeroFS is not fast when detecting changes and finding peers.
This is easy to understand.
Sync solutions based on Software:BitTorrent is not good for real time usages!!!
They are good for syncing larges files but no need for them to start syncing immediately.
