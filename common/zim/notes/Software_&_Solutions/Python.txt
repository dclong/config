====== Python ======
Created Saturday 17 May 2014

1. array, object, pass by ref/value?
2. the conflict of function and module names seems tricky!!!
3. curses, ncurses, NLTK, fuzzywuzzy, weechat and scrapy modules, sounds interesting
In general practice, it's probably not that beneficial. In fact, most Python style guides encourage programmers to place all imports at the beginning of the module file.

cd path/to/foo
python setup.py install --user

If you are using easy_install and would like the package downloaded and installed:

easy_install --prefix=$HOME/.local/ foo

It's a little more work if you are using pip to download and install:

pip install --install-option="--prefix=$HOME/.local" foo

pip install --user mercurial

## Design
1. The bottom-most package in Java should be a file in Python

    Do not use inner classes. Just put classes in the same module
    By convention, things that start with _ are "private"
    It's OK to have "public variables"
2. python does not support method/function overloading.
## numerical
1. by default integer division, import division; float

os.path.splitext(filename)[0]

ord unichar

## Modules
1. argparse
2. getopt: great for paring arguments in a list! very cool, sounds like more general than argparse

the list object has no find method which is inconvenient

return v1, v2 -> returns a tuple (v1, v2)

static variable inside a function in python is tricky, one possible way is to pass an extra variable and use it to as a role of static variable
