====== Amazon S3 ======
Created Friday 04 April 2014

0. Might not be a good solution for personal use, but you can use it together with Enterprise solutions, such as AeroFS.
Don't spend time to figure out how to use it as a secure backup/sync plan.
Wait until mature products come up.

1. s3cmd, AeroFS, Software:TeamDrive

2. It's interesting to combine S3 with EC2.
For example, if I upload images to S3
and I use s3cmd to view directory and files, 
but I also want to operate (e.g., extract meta information), then EC2 can be very help.
If EC2 support Linux, then it's the best!

3. check EC2, sounds like a good product ...

4. It's also possible to mount Amazon S3 as a directory in Linux using S3FS. 
However, I'm mostly worried about security.
