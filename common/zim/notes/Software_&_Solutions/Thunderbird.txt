Created Thursday 03 April 2014


4. Thunderbird is slow very often, see how you can make it faster
I think using tags to filter emails is much faster than search directly, of course!!!!

5. Thunderbird duchuanlong@gmail.com filter doesn't work any more.
The filter file is there but not shown.

6. Any plugin to insert contact information directly?
This can be very useful! Write one if there's no existing one.

7. You universal contact software. Is it better to connect it with Thunderbird?

8. strange, I've moved it a new place but it still places mails in the old place 
fix the problem!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

9. lightning calendar, which online calendars can be synced?
10. Google calendar
11. selective sync using symbolic links, linfig.thunderbird
or write a sync script by yourself

## Shortcut 
1. Alt + T: Pop up the "Tool" menu.
