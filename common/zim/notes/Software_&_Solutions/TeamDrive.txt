====== TeamDrive ======
Created Thursday 03 April 2014

1. It seems that [[TeamDrive]] ignores symbolic links ...
Is possible to keep symbolic links? Just keep these files, don't copy content ...
Similarly, to Dropbox? At least should give options ...

2. It seems that [[TeamDrive]] is slow when syncing database files.
This is easy to understand. 
Actually I think these secure cloud are typically slow
as it's hard for them to do delta synchronization.

3. How to let [[TeamDrive]] show up in the notification aera in Ubuntu?

5. You can check in virtual machine to see whether a local config file works.
Contact support first.

16. you should sync the filter files, let ... point to local ...

6. Teamview mess up file permissions!!!

8. Check how you can link [[TeamDrive]] with Amazon S3 or use local disk 

## Tips

1. [[TeamDrive]] clients might show more space usage than the web dashboard. 
It's because the clients counts everything watched locally including old versions
while the web only shows the true space usage. 

2. [[TeamDrive]] doesn't sync symbolic links currently!!

3. I don't [[TeamDrive]] support the standard hierarchical configuration files.
