====== AeroFS ======
Created Friday 04 April 2014

1. Install [[AeroFS]] server and store your stuff on Amazon S3

3. Can I use multiple servers pointing to Amazon S3?

4. 32 bit version has problems on Debian and LMDE but seems to work well on Ubuntu.

5. Too slow currently, slow to detect changes ..., slow to find peers ...
not a good solutions to use currently
