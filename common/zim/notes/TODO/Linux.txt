====== Linux ======
Created Monday 24 March 2014

## Config
1. figure out where is the best location to put your alias and configuration files, .profile or .bash_profile, check the login shell page

3. What if I put #/bin/bash in .profile? 
Then I think you can use bash specific features. 
But I recommend you to do so. 

## Monitor
2. Debian y450 hdmi audio device not show up 

4. See how you can rename a disk/volumn name in Linux

5. fcitx black box problem, see how to solve it
try it with Mint virtual machine

6. Arch has a comprehensive wiki that is also very helpful for other Linux distributions.
Search Arch wiki keywords ...

4. See how you can set up printer on Linux, e.g., Ubuntu and Debian

5. Keep your eyes on Linux voice control applications, such as Blather, Simon, VoxForge, etc.
And find a good voice to text software on Linux

6. Many deb (if not say for a specific distribution) works best for Ubuntu.
Ubuntu LTS is a great choice for personal use

7. write a script for running before Linux shutdown!!!

1. difference between alias paths and export paths? I think the difference is that whether you can use it in all subshells or not. 
2. You cannot connect to not-approved Linux servers in company network, but if you install a virtual machine you can connect to these Linux servers using the virtual machine!! Bang! This is very cool.

To show groups:
use `groups` or 
for entire group list use cut -d: -f1 [[/etc/group]]

You can xdotool -> move-to-next-monitor to move active window to next monitor in Linux, check http://makandracards.com/makandra/12447-how-to-move-a-window-to-the-next-monitor-on-xfce-xubuntu for more. You can define shortcut Shift + Win + Left/Right for this.

[ ] swap.caps.escape seems to be void after a while, strange!!

2. fix the NFS problem, check ZFS, it seems that it has zfs send functionality

3. See how you can redirect warnings of GUI applications to a file or /dev/null

[ ] write a linux user guide book when you have time
put together all good software and tips you have
