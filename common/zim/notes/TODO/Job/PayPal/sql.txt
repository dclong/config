We have the following schema of a table:

  create table Test (id number, name varchar2(32), desc varchar2(400));
  create index index_test on Test (name);

Which of the following statements will invoke an index scan by oracle
execution plan

 a) select * from test where name='name';
 b) select * from test where name like 'name%';
 c) select * from test where name like '%name';
 d) select * from test where name like '%name%';" 

name like 'name%'
Source: docs.oracle - wild-card searches should not be in a leading position otherwise the condition name like '%name' does not result in a range scan.

How oracle stores the indexes?
B+ tree

Given table A with id, name and age write a query to display distinct pairs or people with same name.

Why are indexes used?
