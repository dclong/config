The string "PAYPAL IS HIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern on a given
number of rows like this: (you may want to display this pattern in a
fixed font for better legibility)

P A H N
 A P L S I I G
  Y I R

And then read line by line: PAHNAPLSIIGYIR

Write the code that will take a string and make this conversion given a
number of rows:

String convert(String text, int nRows);

convert("paypalishiring", 3) should return "pahnaplsiigyir"
