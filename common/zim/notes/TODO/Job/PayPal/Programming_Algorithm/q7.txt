A small directory is hard-coded as an array in the code:

String names[] = { "Elon Musk",
            "Ken Howery",
            "Luke Nosek",
            "Max Levchin",
            "Peter Thiel" };

A requirement is to be able to extend this directory dynamically at
runtime, without persistent storage. The directory can eventually grow
to hundreds or thousands of names and must be searchable by first or
last name.

1) What approach would you take? (Ans: HashMap)
2) Write an implementation for the add and search methods in pseudo-code
using data structures you have in mind.
