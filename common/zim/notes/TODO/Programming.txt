====== Programming ======
Created Tuesday 18 March 2014

1. accepted.ips more, auth.log, refused ... 

2. your shortcomings when programming:
 too many versions without good documentation about which one is the newest 


3. write a shell code to install linux image and the correspodning headers automatically
you can let user select from a list ...





Write an app to scan barcode and search website for coupon, this is an great idea!
And if Walmart allows user to scan using their own phone, it even better!

7. Jonhson's alert at a specific location is great!
You can combine this to get a more powerful alert app




9. write a program to organize your Walmart purchases,
link the pictures, OCR, scan recognize numbers ... 
i think it's possible ...
or check Walmart electronic receipts ...


## Linux
4. write a function to help you run script in a file line by line,
for lines that should be treated together, run them together
this sounds like not easy, mostly, how to group lines correctly ...
use a point to lines in file and so on ...

## Projects
[ ] presentation ideas:
let computer recognize human gesture while doing presentations, combined with voice recognition,
I think it's easy to implement things such waving hand -> go to next slide
this save people hassle of using clipboard, but you should let people using clipboard

I'm acutally thinking more on this, is it possible to let machine highlight words or point at 
words automatically, as we do presentation?
I think it is not hard, but voice recognition is very important!!!

or combine hand gesture and voice, let point point ...
it is possible,
